most commonly asked questions. I collected these questions myself while going
through many Golang interviews. This guide walks you through ten questions
you’ll almost certainly encounter, starting from the fundamentals and moving up
to concurrency.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>For each answer, I also provide references that I highly recommend reading to gain a deeper understanding.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Slices are Go&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;dynamic array&amp;rdquo; and show up everywhere.&lt;br>
A slice is a &lt;strong>descriptor&lt;/strong> —&lt;code>pointer, len, cap&lt;/code> — over an underlying array&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>. Slicing &lt;strong>shares&lt;/strong> that array; &lt;code>append&lt;/code> may &lt;strong>reallocate&lt;/strong> to a new one.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>How Do Containers Work</title><link>https://11me.github.io/posts/how-containers-work/</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 Aug 2025 00:18:30 +0300</pubDate><guid>https://11me.github.io/posts/how-containers-work/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="how-do-containers-work">How Do Containers Work?&lt;/h1>
&lt;h2 id="introduction">Introduction&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>If you&amp;rsquo;ve used Docker or Podman before, you&amp;rsquo;re likely familiar with the concept
of containers. But what exactly is a container? What is it made of? How does it
work? And how does it differ from virtual machines? Even if you think you know
all the answers, you might still learn something new here.&lt;/p>

me for years. Nowadays, people share &lt;del>garbage&lt;/del> everything on social media, but I&amp;rsquo;m not

anyone. It&amp;rsquo;s completely free, just static content hosted on GitHub. I admire
people who maintain personal websites; there&amp;rsquo;s something genuinely cool about
having your own corner of the internet.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
