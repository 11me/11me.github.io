I've always had the desire to start writing, and this feeling has stayed with
me for years. Nowadays, people share ~~garbage~~ everything on social media, but I'm not
fan of social platforms neither sharing on them nor consuming their content. I
decided the time has finally come to create **MY OWN** corner on the internet.

Now I have my own personal website on the internet, and I can share it with
anyone. It's completely free, just static content hosted on GitHub. I admire
people who maintain personal websites; there's something genuinely cool about
having your own corner of the internet.

If you're like me and have always wanted to create your own website, I
encourage you to **DO SO!**.
